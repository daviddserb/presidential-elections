# PresidentialElections

Presidential Elections itâ€™s a project about elections and voting. You need to make an account in order to use it.

If the admin started the elections, you can:

1. Run for president.

2. See all the presidential candidates from the current election and how many votes each candidate has. You can vote only once a day, except for yourself.

3. Check all your votes history from every election.

Pop-up messages will appear after every action to let the user know what happened.

I used: Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS with Bootstrap.
